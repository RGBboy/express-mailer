# express-mailer

Send Emails from the response object.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/RGBboy/express-mailer.png)](http://travis-ci.org/RGBboy/express-mailer)

## Note

If you have updated express-mailer from Version 0.0.2 or earlier there 
have been major API changes. Express Mailer now uses the extension 
pattern and acts off the application object. Usage instructions are 
detailed below. The change now allows you to send emails from outside of 
your routes. For example you could now emit an event from your model and 
have your application respond with an email.

## Installation

Works with Express 3.0.x

    $ npm install express-mailer

## Usage

Express Mailer extends your express application

```javascript
// project/app.js

var app = require('express')(),
    mailer = require('express-mailer');

mailer.extend(app, {
  from: 'no-reply@example.com',
  host: 'smtp.gmail.com', // hostname
  secureConnection: true, // use SSL
  port: 465, // port for secure SMTP
  auth: {
    user: 'gmail.user@gmail.com',
    pass: 'userpass'
  }
});

```

## Views

Mailer views use the same render process as Express. You can use any view engine that Express supports.
Setting up views for mailer is exactly the same as setting up views for Express. For example, to set the
view directory to `project/views` and view engine to `jade` you would write:

```javascript
// project/app.js

app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');
app.set('view engine', 'jade');
```

Then we can write our templates in Jade:

```javascript
// project/views/email.jade

!!! transitional
html
  head
    meta(http-equiv = 'Content-Type', content = 'text/html; charset=UTF-8')
    title= subject
    body
      h1.h1 Lorem ipsum
      p
        strong Lorem ipsum dolor: 
        | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
        br
        |Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
      h2.h2 Lorem ipsum
      p Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.
      p Lorem ipsum:
      ol
        li Lorem ipsum dolor
        li Lorem ipsum dolor
        li Lorem ipsum dolor
```

## Sending an email

You can send an email by calling `app.sendEmail(template, options, callback)`.
To send an email using the template above you could write:

```javascript
app.get('/', function (req, res, next) {
  app.sendEmail('email', {
    to: 'example@example.com', // REQUIRED. This can be a comma delimited string just like a normal email to field. 
    subject: 'Test Email', // REQUIRED.
    otherProperty: 'Other Property', // All additional properties are also passed to the template as local variables.
    transportMethod: 'SMTP' // default is SMTP. Accepts anything that nodemailer accepts
  }, function (err) {
    if (err) {
      // handle error
      console.log(err);
      res.send('There was an error sending the email');
      return;
    }
    res.send('Email Sent');
  });
});
```

You can also send an email by calling `res.sendEmail(template, options, callback)`.
To send an email using the template above you could write:

```javascript
app.get('/', function (req, res, next) {
  res.sendEmail('email', {
    to: 'example@example.com', // REQUIRED. This can be a comma delimited string just like a normal email to field. 
    subject: 'Test Email', // REQUIRED.
    otherProperty: 'Other Property' // All additional properties are also passed to the template as local variables.
  }, function (err) {
    if (err) {
      // handle error
      console.log(err);
      res.send('There was an error sending the email');
      return;
    }
    res.send('Email Sent');
  });
});
```

## Notes

Mailchimp has a bunch of templates that may be a good starting point.
Check them out at https://github.com/mailchimp/Email-Blueprints

## To Do

* Add ability to curry the from address.
* Add checking of options when .sendEmail is called.
